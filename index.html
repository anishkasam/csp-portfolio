          <p>Hi! My name is Anish Kasam, and I am a junior at Dublin High School.</p>
          <p>Unlike many students growing up, math was my favorite subject in school. For as long as I can remember, I loved how straightforward math was. As I got older, I developed an interest in programming and explored languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I was able to utilize my knowledge in math within my programs. My goal is to attend a competitive four-year college, major in computer science and minor in mathematics, then work at a large tech company. In order to achieve this goal, I have taken many relevant advanced courses throughout high school such as Honors Principles of Engineering, AP Statistics, AP Calculus AB, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Calculus BC, and AP Computer Science Applications. I also frequently attend hackathons to explore and create real-life applications. In the summer following my junior year, I was accepted into a research program at UCSB, where I focused on the applications of artificial intelligence in our society. My research paper was titled, "Applications of Convolutional Neural Networks in Chest X-Ray Analyses for the Detection of COVID-19". Attending college would give me the industry knowledge necessary to work with revolutionary technologies that have the potential to completely reinvent our lives. </p>
          <p>My dedication to furthering my education, and my ability to stay motivated are what set me apart. The academic success that I have achieved demonstrates my intelligence and work ethic. I have achieved a 4.42 cumulative GPA, while also taking multiple advanced courses such as Honors Chemistry, Honors Spanish, Honors English, AP Human Geography, AP Chemistry, AP Environmental Science, AP Government, and AP Microeconomics. On top of excelling in school, I have also performed incredibly well on standardized tests. I self-studied for the SAT and received 1560 out of a possible 1600, which was high enough to be awarded the title of National Merit Semifinalist. Additionally, I also scored a perfect 800 out of 800 in the Math II Subject SAT. All of these accomplishments exemplify my drive. Furthermore, I hope to advance my knowledge through the rest of high school and into college.</p>
          <p>Beyond the classroom, I also devote my time to improving my community. I’m a founding member of multiple clubs: the Dublin High School Nothing But Nets Club, Dublin High School Human Rights Watch, and Dublin High School Gael Mentors Program. All of these clubs are aimed at improving either the local or international community. These clubs have given me the opportunity to be a leader and I have learned how to manage and organize multiple people while also balancing school and other extracurricular activities. In addition, I am a varsity athlete on the Dublin High School Men’s Track & Field team. I compete in meets across the state and am ranked in the top 25 for multiple events within the state of California. All of these activities give me the opportunity to give back to my community and push myself in other ways outside of academics.</p>
